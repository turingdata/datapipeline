Welcome to Allied World
-----------------------

We take pride in the products we build and embrace the following:

* Continuous improvement
* Writing production-ready software
* Embracing automation and reproducibility
* Many small steps are better than bigger launches
* Good UX trumps technology every time
* Never leaving a codebase in worse shape than how you found it

We succeed by automating anything that a computer can do better than a human and making our processes as reproducible as possible. This keeps our team lean while allowing us to focus on incremental improvements in our products. These are not our words, but mantras you can live by for making production-ready software that can be supported by a small team:

* The future is uncertain and you will never know less than you know right now
* Quality comes from learning from failure and the need for repetition to create mastery
* Practice creates habits, and habits create mastery of any process or skill
* Routinely inject faults into a system and failure will be less painful when it happens naturally
* Any fool can write a test that helps them today. Good programmers write tests that help the entire team in the future
